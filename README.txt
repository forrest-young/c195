Purpose: This program serves as an easy-to-use interface between a company's database and its employees.
Employees can easily review upcoming appointments, add and update customers and their appointments, as well as
delete records if needed.  They can also use the reports to view personal schedules at a glance and review
any changes which have been made during their session (additions, updates, and deletions are recorded
and can be viewed in the reports section)

After starting and entering a proper username and password, you are presented with a list of every customer
and appointment available from the database.  From here you can click add customer to be brought to an add
customer form, update customer (must have a customer from the table view selected) to go to an update customer
form, or delete customer (must also have customer selected).  The same is true for appointments in the bottom
table view.  After any changes to the database, a record is made in reports which can be viewed from the reports
tab.  There you will also find schedules which can be filtered by selecting a contact from the combo box.  You can also
view and see a total of appointments filtered by appointment type and month in the top left table view by selecting
type and month from the two combo boxes.
